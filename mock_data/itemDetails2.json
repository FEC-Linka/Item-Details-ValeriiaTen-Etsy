  "itemDescription": `If youâ€™re anything like me, I LOVE drinking tea whilst with my life group or simply inviting friends and loved ones into my home.
                      However, just like you, I tend to empty the typical standard mug before I've even sat down to enjoy it.
                      Because of this, I trusted God and was blessed with the idea to create the perfect glass mug.
                      Whether you're new to faith, an evangelist or have different spiritual or non-spiritual beliefs;
                      it's time to revitalise the way you enjoy your refreshments and allow God to pour into your life with a love that extends far beyond the average mug.
                      With 600ml of goodness; my eco-friendly Affirmation Glass Mugs not only limits the number of trips to the kettle but also carries the ultimate confirmation of God's unconditional love for each and every one.`
