  "itemDescription": "Please note: These vases are currently made to order and tracking a 3-4 week turnaround. We're working hard to re build ready to ship inventory =). Perfectly thrown and intentionally altered. Our newest vase collection celebrates the process, embraces imperfection and highlights the beauty of pushing ourselves just a tad further. And, we're honored that this vase series has been selected as an Etsy Design Award Category Finalist! These originally thrown cylinders (the most fundamental shape of pottery) are then, intentionally altered and slip cast. Like my other work, they are clean and timeless, however, these pottery vases have a bit more meaning, presence and purpose. The vases represent everything about a potterâ€™s journey through clay. From the mishaps to the moment it all comes together to beauty of the material itself. I've spent years perfecting to now intentionally create an oops =). Adored by interior designers nationwide and intended for those who appreciate art with substance, unique heirlooms and artisanal, one of a kind pieces. The ceramic vases are a perfect 9th anniversary pottery gift, housewarming gift or hostess gift. Or, a gift to yourself to simply spark joy and make your home a more sacred sanctuary."
